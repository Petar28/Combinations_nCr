 ## Description  ##
 
 The Combinations Calculator will find the number of possible combinations that can be obtained by taking a sample of items from a larger set. Basically, it shows how many different possible subsets can be made from the larger set. For this calculator, the order of the items chosen in the subset does not matter.
 ```
 C(n,r)=n!(r!(n−r)!)  
 For n ≥ r ≥ 0.
 ```
The formula show us the number of ways a sample of “r” elements can be obtained from a larger set of “n” distinguishable objects where order does not matter and repetitions are not allowed. [1] "The number of ways of picking r unordered outcomes from n possibilities." [2]

### Example: ###

> __Choose 2 Prizes from a Set of 6 Prizes__

You have won first place in a contest and are allowed to choose 2 prizes from a table that has 6 prizes numbered 1 through 6. How many different combinations of 2 prizes could you possibly choose?

In this example, we are taking a subset of 2 prizes (r) from a larger set of 6 prizes (n). Looking at the formula, we must calculate “6 choose 2.”

C (6,2)= 6!/(2! * (6-2)!) = 6!/(2! * 4!) = **15 Possible Prize Combinations**

The 15 potential combinations are {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,5}, {1,6}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {2,6}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {3,6}, {4,5}, {4,6}, {5,6}
